<div class="col span_1_of_3">“Corporate Identity Videos” have a wide range of applications. Our corporate clients use these videos for company overview, corporate orientation, product promotion, and job training, to name a few.</div>
<div class="col span_1_of_3">Many corporate profile videos are placed directly on the home page of the client’s website to showcase their products and services in more exciting and interesting visual presentation.</div>
<div class="col span_1_of_3">Other clients use our video projects to introduce customers to the details of their market share and industry presence.

It begins with an interesting and engaging concept. Of course, every project has specific goals, expectations, and desired outcomes. It’s the combining of both ‘objectives’ and ‘concept’ that paves the way for a compelling video project.
&nbsp;
This process begins with <strong>pre-production meetings, script-writing,</strong> and <strong>final script approval</strong>. Once the objectives and creative concept are nicely packaged, we move to a well organized shot list, outlining each day of location production.
&nbsp;
<strong>Location production</strong> typically includes a 2 to 3 person video crew using an HD camera, wireless sound and soft lights. Some productions are well suited for our 12′ to 16′ foot “jib cam”. Other productions are more suited for smaller camera accessories like our broadcast quality Go Pro camera, which is ideal for <a href="http://youtu.be/eaLBHzy84XU" target="_blank">time lapse!</a>

Thanks to HD digital technology, we can now step in to the video editing phase of this project with complete confidence in film-like quality images! It’s now that our story begins to take shape. Here, we begin with the recorded narration and begin to assemble our first cut of this video project, complete with music, text, and animated video graphics. Clients can elect to participate in this 1st cut or wait until the “1st cut viewing”.
&nbsp;
Following our “1st cut viewing”, we make necessary edits, changes, etc, and present the “2nd cut” for client approval.
&nbsp;
In some cases, the 2nd cut, following minor changes, become the final cut. In other cases, we’ll move on to a 3rd cut, then final cut.
&nbsp;
DVD and video streaming then become the delivery method.

<strong>STUDIO PRODUCTION</strong>
We also contract with Comcast Television Studios to provide the latest video production in TV staging, sets and stage lighting. Studio space includes up to 5 cameras, teleprompters, camera booms and enough space to accommodate 100 audience members.
&nbsp;
<strong>PROFESSIONAL NARRATOR</strong>
Our in-house professional video narrator is currently the voice of Rocky Mountain PBS. His vocal style has a baritone resonance like that of James Earl Jones. In addition, 81 Media International also features a variety of other voice talent to suit a range of professional video production styles such as commercial, documentary…
